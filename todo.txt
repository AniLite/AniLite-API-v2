7. Brownie: Add a mailing list for your users. Users can choose to subscribe to particular ongoing Anime. Whenever a new episode of the subscribed anime is released, the users must get an email with the details of the episode. Users should not be able to subscribe to anime that is already complete, and they should be able to freely subscribe/unsubscribe to ongoing anime at any time. In addition, include links at the end of every email sent, that will allow users to unsubscribe from emails completely. That is, even if users subscribe to ongoing anime, if they have unsubscribed to email notifications, they should not receive emails

8. Extra brownie: Allow admins to auto-add anime episodes at a particular time. Example, an admin of the site should be able to mark the time for the release of an episode and the server should automatically notify the subscribed users about the release of the episode some specified amount of time (say 10 mins) before the marked time, without any manual intervention by the administrator.

9. Ultimate brownie: To achieve the previous task, replace scheduling features provided by email service providers with your own implementation using a Message Broker and a Task Queue. Popular choices  are Redis for the Message Broker and Celery for the Task Queue.
